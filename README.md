Educational Project: CSS Selectors and Their Specificity
Project Description

This project is an educational example using HTML and CSS that demonstrates how different CSS selectors work, including their types, hierarchy, and specificity (weight).
The project is designed to help understand how the browser selects elements for styling and which styles have higher priority.

Features

The project demonstrates:

Tag selectors (h1, p)

Class selectors (.text, .text3, .text4, .text5)

ID selectors (#title2)

Descendant selectors (div p)

Child selectors (ul > li)

Adjacent sibling selectors (div + p)

General sibling selectors (h3 ~ p)

Attribute selectors (a[href])

Examples of CSS specificity

Each HTML element contains a text description explaining which CSS selector is applied to it.

Different types of styling are used: background colors, borders, and text colors.

The project clearly shows why some elements are styled while others are not.

Suitable for practice, lab work, or self-study of CSS.

Technologies Used:
